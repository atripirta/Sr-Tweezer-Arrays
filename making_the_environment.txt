For Linux systems:
1) In the same folder the "getting-started-with-pico.pdf" file (Chapter 1, 2 and 3) contains how to setup the SDK for running a simple blink C-code on RPi Pico.
2) After configuring and running the blink code. One can go in the ddssweeper folder edit the main dds-sweeper.c code to their convenience and then in the build
folder use the terminal to create a ".uf2" file by using the command "make".
3) This file can be directly copy-pasted on the RPi. After copying the RPi will be running the firmware whenever it is powered on.
4) Once the connections using the schematic are made, then the DDS can be controlled using serial communication between RPi and PC.
5) The serial communication script ("tests.ipynb") format can be run on Jupyter Notebook.

For Windows systems:
